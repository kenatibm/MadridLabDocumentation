# MobileFirst Foundation 8 Ionic Lab Documentation

This repository contains the supporting files for the IBM MobileFirst Foundation with Ionic workshop. This work was derived from a series of labs created for technical sales enablement for IBM Tech Sellers.

* `workbooks/` - The workbooks are maintained in the Markdown language.  Each lab has its own folder within the workbooks/ folder.  Content was developed using the [MacDown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/) editor.
* `documentation/` - Any additional supporting documentation that would be helpful.  Currently this folder contains a presentation which describes the approach used to manage the source artifacts in Git at [https://github.com/kenatibm/MobileFirst-Foundation-8-Ionic-Lab.git]().
* `presentation/` - Future home of the PPT presentation used to introduce the labs.
